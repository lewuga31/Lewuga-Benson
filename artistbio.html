<p class="sentence">As an interdisciplinary artist and filmmaker, Léwuga Tata Benson’s work bridges cultures and explores the dynamic interplay between identity, environmental sustainability, and human connection. <br>Rooted in his Ogoni heritage in Nigeria, Benson draws inspiration from the tradition of repurposing to prevent waste.<br> This ethos infuses Benson’s art, as seen in installations like <em>The Land Gives Until It No Longer Can (2022), Hang in There (2022), Traces of Displacement (2023), Carrying Identity, Carrying The Weight (2023), and Fueling Change (2024)</em>.<br>Embracing Ogoni storytelling, Benson’s work engages all the senses, integrating songs, dance, and props, creating a holistic experience for visitors. His artistic practice incorporates these traditions to create immersive narratives that provoke thought, foster empathy, and celebrate cultural richness.<br> Benson’s journey has been marked by awards and accolades, including the NYSCA 2024 Support for Artists Grant and the Gregory Capasso Scholarship for outstanding work in film.</p>
